Welcome to the first day of Seattle Snowmass Community Summer Study!!! We are excited to welcome you to Seattle, and are looking forward to an interesting and productive workshop. This is the first of the daily emails you will receive highlighting topics for the coming day. More information, including a link to the program, can be found on the [conference website](https://seattlesnowmass2021.net).

## Registration

Registration for the conference will be available from 7:30am - 7pm in the lobby of [Kane Hall](http://uw.edu/maps/?kne) (see here [for more info on all workshop buildings](http://seattlesnowmass2021.net/meetings/)). The first session starts at 9am. Most people will need to register before - so it will be a madhouse. Please come as early as possible! If you registered Saturday, there is no reason to show up early other than finding friends and rebuilding community!

## Logistics

Details about the day are listed below, including zoom links for those participating remotely. Questions for speakers can be entered into the “Question Document” for each session, in addition to being taken “live” as possible - please be sure to list the name of the speaker you wish to respond to your question.

Coffee will be [served tomorrow](http://seattlesnowmass2021.net/catering/) starting at 9:45 am. If you need coffee before the first session please pick it up on your way in.
