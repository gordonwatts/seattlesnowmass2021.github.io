## Travel Awards

The travel support award assists members of the community with travel fares and conference registration fees for the Snowmass Community Summer Study Workshop held on July 17-26, 2022 at the University of Washington, Seattle. The award is aimed at members of the community who would not otherwise be able to attend.

The first round of travel awards are being awarded and we are doing our best to find additional sources of funding to meet the demand. Unfortunately, we are no longer accepting further travel award requests.
