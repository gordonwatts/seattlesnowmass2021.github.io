# Outreach activities


Outreach events will be organised during the summer with the intent of raising awareness of the Snowmass proceedings and related physics topics. Physicists from the workshop are invited to join colleagues and the public for a live virtual tour of the [LIGO Hanford Observatory](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA), a [Colliderscope](https://colliderscope.web.cern.ch/) performance near the UW campus, and community outreach events to engage directly with the public in small groups.
We are planning a series of events at the Seattle [Pacific Science Center](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org), at [Ada's cafe](https://www.adasbooks.com) and on the University of Washington, Seattle campus.

At the Pacific Science Center, kids and families will engage with researchers and students of the University of Washington and learn about topics such as Dark Matter, Gravitational Waves or Cosmic Rays. During each session, we will use demonstrations and craft to illustrate the physics concepts behind these phenomenoms.

The outreach committee of the LOC is still exploring other opportunities. If you are interested in developing some outreach activities this summer or if you would like to participate to these events as a science communicator, please [get in touch with us](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu)!
