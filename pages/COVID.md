We are expecting over 600 people to join us over the course of 10 days. Community spread exists in Seattle (rated as [Medium](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/community-level.aspx) as of 6/29), but people will be arriving from hot spots around the country to this workshop. It is almost certain there will be a case or two at the workshop. We must all work together as a community to make sure that we keep as safe as possible before the conference and prevent any spread at the conference.

## What to do before you arrive

* Please make sure you've had at least one booster! There is no better way to limit the spread of COVID-19 than making sure your vaccinations are up to date!
* Download and install the [WANotify app](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/wa-notify) - this will enable automatic and anonymous contact tracing - and will be very helpful when we do have a case at the workshop.
* Pack masks. The N95 and FFP masks are best to protect you, and medical masks will help protect others. We will also have a supply of masks on hand.
* Please bring self-tests if you have any to spare for the trip. We will have a limited number on hand locally (which have been imported from France).

## What to do while attending the workshop

* **Masking with a well-fitted, high-quality mask (KN95 or similar) is required in all indoor meeting spaces.** For speakers, mask wearing is recommended, and required in rooms where the speakers are closer than 2 meters to the audience.
* Masking is not required while enjoying our coffee breaks, but please keep your mask on while in line collecting the coffee and snacks and move to an out-of-the-way area to eat. If the weather is nice, feel free to enjoy the coffee with colleagues outdoors.

* When approaching the help desk or registration desk, even the ones in a non-snowmass specific area, make sure to wear a mask. The professionals running these desks live by their ability to host conferences and a case of COVID would severely impact their ability to work (and help us out at this workshop).
* Please try to keep track of people you have significant interactions with and meetings you attend, just in case we need to perform contact tracing.
* Look at the daily emails where COVID cases will be reported to help you adjust your behavior to a level you are comfortable with.
* For all other meeting rooms, buildings, etc., at UW, masking is **strongly** recommended. There are some places where masks are required around the university. Please follow all signage.
* Please be respectful of others' interaction comfort levels.

## What to do if you have symptoms

If you have symptoms that are consistent with COVID please attend the workshop remotely until you test negative.

* All in-person participants will get links to Zoom rooms - please see the daily emails for zoom links!
* For more information on COVID symptoms, please see the [CDC site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If you are experiencing expected allergy-like symptoms, please see the "What should I do if my symptom's are due to seasonal allergies" on the [UW FAQ](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/staff-faq/)

Testing:

* University of Washington offers PCR testing. [Look for the University District testing option here](https://www.uwmedicine.org/coronavirus/testing). These are PCR tests, which means results can take up to 48 hours to be reported. You'll need your medical insurance (if you are uninsured, then testing is free).
* Self-Testing. We have a limited number of tests on hand to provide to people with symptoms who haven't brought their own.
  * Since you have symptoms, please do not approach the registration desk or come to indoor Snowmass spaces. There is a box outside the Kane Hall Lobby labeled "Snowmass" and that will contain a few self tests. Please email [confuw@uw.edu](mailto:confuw@uw.edu) to let them know you are going to pick it up a test so they can make sure the test box is stocked before you arrive. Please do not approach the desk with symptoms.
  * To take the test, please find a place that away from people (your hotel room is ideal, for example). You'll need about 15 minutes to determine your status. Please do this as soon as you can - the modern variants of Omicron can transmit very quickly.

## What to do if you test positive

COVID is now a regular part of our landscape - many of us are going to be dealing with it. As a community we can work together to make sure that we limit its spread when it is discovered.

* Please isolate yourself. The most logical place for this is your hotel or dorm room. The CDC has extensive guidelines on what to do, [which can be found on their website](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html).
* Please send an email to conference services at [confuw@uw.edu](mailto:confuw@uw.edu) - they will notify the University of Washington and help with contract notification and warning. Your name will not be made public.
* If you need help, please do not hesitate to contact us the same address above. We realize having to go into isolation in a strange city can be a daunting - we will do our best to help.
* The university has a large hospital attached to it. The emergency room entrance is about a 15 minute walk from our main conference buildings. It is the main hospital in all of the Pacific Northwest and provides a complete range of care.

If you are staying in the dorms:

* Guests staying in single occupancy rooms may isolate in place
* Guests who are staying in double occupancy rooms can be moved into an isolation room on campus, or the positive guest can choose to isolate off campus
* Guests are not obligated to stay on campus during isolation or beyond their original check-out date
* Guests may order delivery food or we can deliver three hot meals to their room for $40/day
* The guest will be responsible for all additional isolation housing and dining costs
