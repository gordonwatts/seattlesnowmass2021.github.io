Seattle is a large city, and all the options you'd expect in a city this size are available. This page gathers a number of lodging options for this meeting.

## Dorm Rooms

**We are very sorry - the Dorm rooms have sold out!**

The primary lodging recommended by the workshop are private dorm rooms on North campus within 0.4 miles from the workshop venue ([7 minute walk](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=7cfe6dc3-30e4-4618-9467-e3830152a7d4&cp=47.65828~-122.308777&lvl=17&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027)). The room layout is a Double room, with private bathroom, desk, and excellent wifi. [Madrona Hall](https://hfs.uw.edu/Campus-Living/Undergraduate-Housing/Madrona-Hall) is recently built and modern construction (as an example of one of the dorm room buildings).

The UW Dorms allow one block per conference - which means while there is some flexability, there isn't a lot for check-in and check-out. Here are how prices work:

| Dates | Single Occupancy | Double Occupancy | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
July 17-July 25 | $864 | $516 | Everyone must book this block |
Prior to July 17 | $115.50/night | $72/night | You may book up to 2 days |
After July 25 | $115.50/night | $72/night | You may book up to 2 days |

The maxium stay is from July 15 - July 27. Arrival on the day before the workshop, July 16, and departure on the last day of the workshop, July 26, will cost $1095 ($864 + $115.50 + $115.50) for single occupancy ($109.50/night). It is not possible to book outside these dates in the dorms, nor is it possible to not book between July 17 and 25.

If you book and wish to cancel your booking, you can for a $20 non-refundable reservation fee.

All guests, no matter of age, must be registered with the conference through our housing reservation website. Children nine years of age or older must occupy a bed and are charged the full package rate. Children eight years of age or younger may bring a sleeping bag to use on the floor of a fully occupied room at no additional charge. A fully occupied room is one in which all available beds have been paid for at the package rate. Cots, cribs or extra bedding for those children sleeping on the floor are neither provided nor available. There may never be more than two adults and two children assigned to a room. Children in University of Washington residence halls and/or dining facilities must be supervised at all times by an adult assuming full responsibility for their safety and behavior.

All cancellation requests must be submitted in writing to the Conference Services Office.

If the cancellation is received by the Conference Services Office on or before Friday, June 24, 2022, the prepayment will be refunded less the $20.00 Housing Reservation Fee.

If the cancellation request is received by the Conference Services Office after Friday, June 24, 2022 but before the scheduled arrival date, the prepayment will be refunded less the $20.00 Housing Reservation Fee and Late Reservation Fee (if applicable) plus ten percent of the package rate or one day of room and board (plus applicable tax), whichever is greater.

If no advance cancellation is received by the Conference Services Office and you do not check in, no refund will be issued.

  * If that block has run out, [there is a UW Exclusive Rate](https://www.staypineapple.com/watertown-hotel-seattle-wa/uw-exclusive-rates?showbanner=543&promocode=UWR) which isn't as good, but is better than the rack rate.

## Other Seattle Hotels

THe College Inn, though we do not have a negociated rate, is a pretty special small unique hotel:

* [College Inn](https://www.collegeinnseattle.com/) - Unique/boutique hotel with hostel-like experience (family owned). Located a [5 minute walk](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=befd816b-ca73-4d9f-8318-5a29b4598e4f&cp=47.656136~-122.312218&lvl=18&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027) (about 0.3 mile) closer than the dorms. Many rooms now have private bathrooms, but not all. At the time this page was written, rooms were $190/night.

There are several other hotels near UW campus, and many luxury Hotels in the Downtown Seattle (Typical rate $180~$260/night). They are easily accessible via Uber/Lyft, city bus, light rail or rental car. We advise starting your search near light rail stations - there are two light rail stops on or near campus ([complete stop map](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules?route=1%20Line)). The downtown light rail stops are, with links to _booking.com_:
* [North Gate](https://www.bing.com/maps/n/Northgate-Seattle-WA?id=370b70b4c920d2197f3340af13a263df#) Several economic hotels are within 35 mins of public transportation to the meeting rooms.
* [Capitol Hill](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=c33d7755-6ff6-41eb-91e8-f2f0a8cd09d5&cp=47.6188~-122.325786&lvl=16&imgid=4d6d29d9-8a29-47fe-9818-fada5c2777df&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027) Very few hotels are availible in this mostly residential neigbhorhood. AirBnB, however, does have options. This station is a 4-8 minute trip with a 10 minute walk to the meeting rooms.
* [Westlake](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=cc8ddbcd-d2bb-4181-bffd-f104693b15b7&cp=47.610676~-122.352731&lvl=14&imgid=d27d92c7-5547-46d8-bf3e-ccd886d95a46&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027). There are a lot of hotels availible in this area. The station is a 12-16 minute trip with a 10 minute walk to the meeting rooms.
* University Street. This is very close to the _Westlake_ station, and so hotels accessible by it appear above.

## AirBnB

You might find comfortable rooms or even boat house with economic rates. Make sure your institution will reimburse you for AirBnB. A number of places do not for insurance reasons (for example, some national labs will not).

* North of the university is also possible, and accessible by bike (via the [Burke-Gillman trail](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail)) as well as bus.
* If you are willing to deal with a fairly brutal schedule, you can stay on one of the islands and use the ferry to get back and forth. But be warned that is at least one hour communte each way. The ferries do have good wifi... And the islands are amazing, so this option might be attractive for some.
