## Dorm Rooms

The primary lodging sponsored by the workshop are private dorm rooms on North campus within 0.4 miles from the workshop venue ([7 minute walk](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=7cfe6dc3-30e4-4618-9467-e3830152a7d4&cp=47.65828~-122.308777&lvl=17&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027)). The typical room layout is Double room, with private bath, desk, and excellent wifi. The price will be close to $110/night for single, and $68/night for a shared room. [Madrona Hall](https://hfs.uw.edu/Campus-Living/Undergraduate-Housing/Madrona-Hall) is recently built and modern construction (as an example of one of the dorm room buildings). Each room has a private bathroom.

There are several other hotels near UW campus, and many luxury Hotels in the Downtown Seattle (Typical rate $180~$260/night). They are easily accessible via Uber/Lyft, city bus, light rail or rental car. We advise starting your search near light rail stations - there are two light rail stops on or near campus ([complete stop map](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/routes-schedules?route=1%20Line)). The downtown light rail stops are, with links to _booking.com_:

* [Capitol Hill](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=c33d7755-6ff6-41eb-91e8-f2f0a8cd09d5&cp=47.6188~-122.325786&lvl=16&imgid=4d6d29d9-8a29-47fe-9818-fada5c2777df&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027) Very few hotels are availible in this mostly residential neigbhorhood. AirBnB, however, does have options. This station is a 4-8 minute trip with a 10 minute walk to the meeting rooms.
* [Westlake](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=cc8ddbcd-d2bb-4181-bffd-f104693b15b7&cp=47.610676~-122.352731&lvl=14&imgid=d27d92c7-5547-46d8-bf3e-ccd886d95a46&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027). There are a lot of hotels availible in this area. The station is a 12-16 minute trip with a 10 minute walk to the meeting rooms.
* University Street This is very close to the _Westlake_ station, and so hotels accessible by it appear above.

## AirBnB

You might find comfortable rooms or even boat house with economic rates. Cautious! Make sure you exercise due diligence by carefully reviewing user comments in order to stay safely through the whole workshop. Also, make sure your institution will reimburse you for AirBnB. A number of places do not for insurance reasons (for example, some national labs will not).

* North of the university is also possible, and accessible by bike (via the [Burke-Gillman trail](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail)) as well as bus.
* If you are willing to deal with a fairly brutal schedule, you can stay on one of the islands and use the ferry to get back and forth. But be warned that is at least one hour each way. The ferries do have good wifi... And the islands are amazing.
