The Local Organizing Committee of the Snowmass Summer Study is committed to making this event accessible to everyone in our community. We are following best practices both in general event design (e.g., universal wheelchair access for all rooms) and in working with individual participants to understand and meet their specific needs within our resources.

* **We have set up a survey at [https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69) to collect information about each individual’s needs for childcare and/or hearing, mobility, dietary, breastfeeding/pumping, medical, or related accommodations.** Note that while earlier surveys have collected general information about accessibility, this non-anonymous, individual survey will give us the information we need to rent the correct amount and types of adaptive furniture, assistive listening devices, etc., to meet the needs of individual participants. You may alternatively contact the organizers at [snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu). 
* **It will be a huge help to the organizers and will allow us to best meet the community’s needs if participants can provide this information as early as possible.**

Below is information about various accessibility measures. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have questions or comments. We will update this page as more details become available.

## Remote Meeting Access
All the formal meetings will have Zoom rooms connected. We will carefully run the large rooms and make sure audio works well. Smaller rooms will have speakers available to the chairs - and they will be responsible for connecting. The plenary sessions and working groups will be recorded and made available for later viewing. We will not be broadcasting the audience, and in the larger rooms we will not broadcast the speaker. In the smaller meetings the decision to broadcasting an image of the speaker will be up to the people in the meeting, as it is for anyone giving a remote presentation.
 
## Visual
* Presenters will be strongly encouraged to use colorblindness-friendly color schemes.
* Presenters will be strongly encouraged to add alt-text to their figures.
* Green (not red) laser pointers will be required and provided by the organizers for presenters' use.
 
## Audio/Hearing
* Live captioning has so far been booked for all plenary sessions and for two tracks of the science program. Please fill out [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69) ASAP if you require this service so we can make sure we have sufficient coverage.
* If you need an assistive listening device, please fill out [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69) ASAP so we can plan accordingly.
 
## Mobility
* All rooms and buildings will be wheelchair-accessible and furniture will be arranged to preserve this access. 
* Meals and break stations will be arranged to make it possible to wait in line while seated. 
* Participants can request specialized furniture in meeting rooms via [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69).
* Due to construction, the original dorm rooms we were planning to have booked have become unavailable, and we do not have certain information about bed height in the new rooms. We will provide updated information when the new reservations are finalized. If you need a specific bed height, please request it via [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69).
* Access to shuttle transportation between buildings can be requested via [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69).
* [Map of the Seattle campus](https://depts.washington.edu/ceogis/Public/Accessibility/Map) that includes buildings and dorms we will be using, along with elevators, stair locations, wheelchair accessibility, etc. The page takes a short time to load.
* Walking time from the dorm rooms to Meany Hall (east side of campus) is 5 minutes (includes one set of stairs). From the dorm rooms to the HUB (west side of campus) is 10 minutes (contains two sets of stairs). All the rooms are between these two locations. The stairs on this route, between the dorms and Meany, are the equivalent of about two floors. The second set of stairs, from Meany Hall up to Red Square, are another two floors. Both sets can be avoided by adding about 3-5 minutes of walking time in each case. Both Google and Bing maps have all the walking paths on campus and can be used to navigate the campus. As the locations the workshop uses are updated we will update this information.
 
## Dietary
Participants can request food conforming to dietary restrictions using [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69).
 
## Private space
Participants who require access to private space for breastfeeding, pumping, or medical reasons can request this via [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69).
 
## Childcare
Organizers are assessing the demand for and feasibility of organizing group childcare. Please describe your needs via [the survey](https://forms.gle/erjFnaWbWVpYXJb69) if you are interested.
 
## Mental Health
In addition to the many spaces that will be available for formal and informal discussions, we are looking into the possibility of providing a quiet room where participants can rest without interaction.
