## Private space and nursing room

We have reserved 1 room in Kane Hall and 2 rooms in the HUB as personal rooms. Each room is equipped with a refrigerator. Please [Contact Us](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu) to reserve time slots for usage.

## Child care

We recommend two off-campus child care facilities. 

For toddlers and younger: 
- [Bright Horizons](https://child-care-preschool.brighthorizons.com/wa/seattle/uvillage) for daycare

For K-12 kids:
- [LASER Childcare at Bryant](https://www.laserchildcare.org/sites/laser-at-bryant) for summer camps

## Shared nanny 

We are working with the [UW Youth Protection](https://www.washington.edu/youth/) to arrange shared nanny/babysitter services ($5/hr per kid). Folks can post job descriptions to hire nannies from sites below.

- [SitterCity](https://www.sittercity.com/uw)

- OYPC [job site](https://www.washington.edu/youth/youth-at-uw-events/summer-jobs-fair/)

Kids with 5 years of age or older can be hosted in the Mary Gates Hall R206, a 5 min walk from the workshop venue. Nannies (either group share or individual) can use this room without additional cost. Please contact us 3 weeks in advance to arrival dates in order to reserve a seat for you.
