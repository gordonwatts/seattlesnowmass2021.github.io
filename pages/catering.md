## Coffee Breaks

Most days there are two coffee breaks, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon

Every day:

- Morning Coffee Break (served from 9:45am to 11am)
  - Kane Hall, first floor lobby
  - Kane Hall, Walker Ames Room (2nd floor)
  - HUB South Ballroom (only from Monday 7/18 to Wed 7/20)
- Afternoon Coffee Break (served from 4:45pm to 5:45pm)
  - Kane Hall, first floor lobby
  - Kane Hall, Walker Ames Room (2nd floor)

The posters will remain up in the HUB South Ballroom until the end of the day on 7/20. Please come by and see them there on your coffee break (and the reception).

Please continue to wear your mask while picking up your drinks and snacks, please move away from the coffee serving station before unmasking and enjoying the coffee. The HUB ballroom is rather large, and so it is very easy to move away from the serving area before unmasking.

## Box Lunches

Many of you (more than we were expecting!) ordered box lunches! To pick them up, bring your ticket that was inside your registration envelope to Kane Hall Lobby before 12:45PM. Once youâ€™ve collected the lunch please feel free to enjoy it outdoors (the meeting rooms in Kane Hall do not allow eating).

If there are any lunches left over at 12:45PM they will be sold on a first come first served basis.

## Reception

Come say hello to everyone - this Snowmass meeting provides a real opportunity to reconnect with your friends and colleagues that you've only seen by zoom over the last few years. The reception is free to everyone who registered, and will take place in the HUB South Ballroom on Monday night, July 18th at 7pm for 2 hours!

## Dinner

The conference banquet will be served in the HUB Ballrooms on 7-22, Friday. The doors open at 7:30 pm. Dinner will be served at about 8pm. Please bring your dinner ticket with you - the style will be buffet! Dinner includes most non-alcoholic drinks. There is also a cash bar for wine and beer!
