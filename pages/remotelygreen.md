One of recognized challenges with the virtual and/or hybrid meeting formats is that they offer limited opportunities for chance or planned encounters with other participants.

In partnership with [Remotely Green](https://remotely.green) we are running a couple of “virtual networking” events this week.

Each event lasts 45 minutes and allows you to meet and have around 7 rounds of 6 minute chats with up to 3 people in each round. Some icebreaker topics will be suggested based on some topic choices you will choose. See the short video at the bottom of the Remotely Green webpage for a better idea.

This is obviously a bit of an experiment. I hope you all will join in, whether you are participating remotely or in-person in Snowmass. It should be both an opportunity to meet both old and new colleagues and also help us explore one piece of the larger puzzle of hybrid/virtual meetings.
To participate you will need to create an account on the Remotely Green platform. It is free and only takes a minute or two. There is a helpful video and pdf showing you what you need to do:

This experiment is a follow-on to the blueprint workshop and [“Learning from the Pandemic: the Future of Meetings in HEP and Beyond” report] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15783) organized by [IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org) last year.

## Early Career Focused Event

The first event is meant primarily for early career people and will take place on Monday, 18 July from 13:00-13:45 PDT.

Looking forward to meeting some of you on Monday!

## General Event

We will also organize a more general Snowmass-wide networking event on the platform after the sessions on Wednesday 20 July (details to be announced later).
