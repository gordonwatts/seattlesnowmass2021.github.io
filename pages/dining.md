Seattle has many great dining options, most of which are a short walk, bus ride,
train ride, or hired ride from the conference venue or your lodging. We recommend
using your favorite app or search tool to find something you like.

We provide here a list of options that are within walking distance of the
conference venue that should be particularly convenient to access for attendees.
There are four main areas with clusters of dining options:
