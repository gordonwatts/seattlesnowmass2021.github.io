We encourage you to also join us for the workshop dinner. To keep costs reasonable, the price of each dinner ticket includes the food only (including dessert and coffee/tea). We will have a cash/credit card bar for people to purchase wine and drinks in the dinner venue. The cost of the dinner is $49. Children under 12 years of age are free. Dietary preferences should be listed on the registration form.

On July 27, they day after the workshop, there is a day-trip to visit LIGO/Hanford. The cost of the complete day is $80 dollars, and includes the tour and the bus ride there and back.

Refunds are possible for in-person registration before July 1st. A $75 processing fee will be charged. If you will miss the workshop due to COVID-19, please contact the local organizing committee ([via email](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu)) to request a refund, and please get better as fast as possible!!

## Virtual Registration

| Registration Type | Normal* |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Full | $150 |
| Early Career | Free |

Virtual registration is available now!

* [Full registration is the same link as always](https://cvent.me/vz43ry)
* [Early-Career registration can be found here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ydq7d4wuUdmVjdotEaxqCMhAOECUTSCUPlCmB8_gEnQ/edit).

It is possible to switch from in-person registration to virtual (or the other direction!). However, this must be done by hand. Please send an email to [confuw@uw.edu](mailto:confuw@uw.edu), with the request and make sure to include your name and email you used for the original registration along with the confirmation number from your registration email. The change will be credited or refunded directly to the card. If you are a member of the early career community then you will get a full refund and will have to re-register at the virtual early-career registration link.

## Lunch

Lunch is not included in the base cost of the workshop. Each day has 2 hours set aside for lunch. This should be plenty of time for most people to travel off-campus to find a restaurant. There are also various places on-campus (in the Student Union Building - pizza, sandwiches, etc.). However, if you want, you can also ask for a boxed lunch to be held for you near the registration desk. The cost is $20/day. It includes a sandwich, fruit, water, cookie or similar. Your dietary requirements will be honored (see the additional workshop information section below).

## Information Requested

This section outlines the information we request on the registration form and what we plan to do with it.

This information will be used for printing the badge. If your "first and last name for badge" is left blank on the registration form, then your First and Last name will be used for the badge.

*Attendee Demographic Information*

The Position, Gender, and Racial & Ethnicity information will not be reported anywhere on an individual basis.

*Additional workshop Information*

A list of participants will be published on our website. If you do not wish to be listed, please select NO. Of course, it will be a great way to see who else is at the workshop, so we encourage you to mark yourself as visible!

The dietary requests will be seen by catering for the coffee preparation and the dinner. If this is left unanswered then we assume you can eat everything!
