Dietary preferences should be listed on the registration form.

On July 27, they day after the workshop, there is a day-trip to visit LIGO/Hanford. The cost of the complete day is $80 dollars, and includes the tour and the bus ride there and back.

Refunds are possible for in-person registration before July 1st. A $75 processing fee will be charged. If you will miss the workshop due to COVID-19, please contact the local organizing committee ([via email](mailto:snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu)) to request a refund, and please get better as fast as possible!!

## Virtual Registration

It is possible to switch from in-person registration to virtual (or the other direction!). However, this must be done by hand. Please send an email to [confuw@uw.edu](mailto:confuw@uw.edu), with the request and make sure to include your name and email you used for the original registration along with the confirmation number from your registration email. The change will be credited or refunded directly to the card. If you are a member of the early career community then you will get a full refund and will have to re-register at the virtual early-career registration link.

## Lunch

Lunch is not included in the base cost of the workshop. Each day has 2 hours set aside for lunch. This should be plenty of time for most people to travel off-campus to find a restaurant. There are also various places on-campus (in the Student Union Building - pizza, sandwiches, etc.). However, if you want, you can also ask for a boxed lunch to be held for you near the registration desk. The cost is $20/day. It includes a sandwich, fruit, water, cookie or similar. Your dietary requirements will be honored (see the additional workshop information section below).

If you want to add a box lunch after registration (before July 12, noon Seattle time), you need only modify your registration. Use the link sent to you as part of the registration and long with your registration code. Select "Modify" and move through the screens to add lunches. You will then be charged the difference.
