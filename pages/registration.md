We are looking forward to seeing you here in Seattle in July!

Two steps need to be completed to register for this event:

1. Please register with the `indico` system at the [registration page]().
2. Please complete payment with the University of Washington here.

It would be a huge help if you could use the same email address at both places. If that is not possible, please make sure your first and last names are the same. If this also isn't possible, we will be getting in touch when we try to reconcile the two sets of information!

## Early Bird Registration

Early bird registration runs until June 5th. The cost of in-person registration is $750, and $375 if you are early career (a  student or postdoc, or the equivalent).

## Normal Registration

Normal registration starts June 6th. All costs are projected - depending on the number of early bird registrations we receive, we will be working hard to keep costs down - focusing first on our the early career community. The costs for in-person will at least as high as early-bird registration (and most likely higher).

The cost of in-person registration is projected to by $850, for early career we expect it to be $425.

We will also open remote registration at this time. A remote registration gives zoom access to all plenary and parallel meetings. The projected cost for remote registration is $500, and $100 for early career registration.

Finally, we will also make an _observer_ registration possible. This will give zoom access to all plenary sessions (first and last 1.5 days). This is projected to cost $100.

## Late Registration

Please do your best to avoid this. This is beyond our catering order window, and there will be few if any slots available for dinner. We will, of course, do our best. We expect the cost of late in-person registration will $1200, and $600 for early career members.

Remote and observer registrations will continue at the levels set during _Normal Registration_.

## Diner

At the time of registration you will also have the option to join the conference dinner. This part of the registration occurs as you check out on the UW site. Please make sure to select guests and any meal preferences. We are expecting some 80% of people attending this Snowmass workshop to want to join in the dinner, according to the attendance survey. We should have room for everyone, but please do not expect many last minute seats being available!
