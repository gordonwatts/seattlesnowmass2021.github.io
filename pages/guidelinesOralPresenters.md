title: Guidelines for Oral Presenters
---

These guidelines are for oral presentations. For the poster guidelines, see [https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22303/abstracts/](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22303/abstracts/).

Following these guidelines will keep the conference running smoothly and make your presentation more accessible to all participants, including those with colorblindness, low vision, who are Deaf/deaf or hard of hearing, and/or who are participating virtually. We strongly encourage you to follow these guidelines.

* **Upload early.** All plenary talks and some of the parallel science tracks at the summer study will be live-captioned. The captioners are able to achieve a higher accuracy if they have access to talk materials (slides and/or presenter notes) to Indico several days ahead of time.
  * If you are uploading anything other than PDF, please upload a partner PDF file. PDF tends to be more accessible to the community.
* **Check A/V ahead of time.** The presentation machines supplied by the workshop have PDF and PowerPoint capabilities. If you have any questions please find us during the break to enable a test.
* **Stick to your time limit.**
* **Fonts.** Make sure fonts are at least size 18 and that there is good contrast between text and background. Avoid all-caps text.
* **Colors.** Avoid using color alone to convey information in plots, or check to make sure that colors in plots are distinguishable to those with colorblindness. A few tools that can help with this:
  * For determining whether the color scheme you already use is accessible:
    * Color Oracle: [https://colororacle.org/](https://colororacle.org/)
    * Color Contrast Analyser from the Paciello Group: [https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)
  * For choosing a new accessible color scheme, here is one from the Belle-II collaboration (scroll to the bottom): [https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2D/repos/belle2style/browse](https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2D/repos/belle2style/browse)
* **Alt-text.** For electronic versions of presentations posted to Indico, make "alt-text" descriptions for images, which make their content accessible to people who use screen-reader technology.
