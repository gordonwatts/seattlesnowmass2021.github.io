# Early Career Panel

The Snowmass Early Career Panel will take place at 12:15 pm on Friday, July 22, 2022.
We will learn about the exciting and rewarding career opportunities open to you by hearing from our high energy physics alumni with a variety of career paths and different levels of experience. The panelist will provide an overview of the current job market, practical tips and tricks on how to move to that area. In particular, how to translate very skills and competencies developed at academic training into a languaguage understood by other career sectors.

Bring your lunch to join the panel discussion.
