## Code of Conduct

Snowmass is a DPF sponsored activity, therefore we embrace the [DPF Core Principles and Community Guidelines (CP&CG)](/assets/docs/DPF-CPCG-05.03.2022.pdf) as a code of conduct for our event.

A slide to show at the start of sessions [can be found here](/assets/coc-slide.pdf). If you need to contact the Code-Of-Conduct team, made up of members of the DPF Ethics committee, please email [snowmass-code@uw.edu](mailto:snowmass-code@uw.edu).

We encourage everyone to read the CP&CG.  It has 3 parts:

- Core principles: what our community values most
- Community guidelines: expectations of behavior 
- Accountability: procedures with an emphasis on early intervention for the wellbeing of all community members

The CP&CG is everyoneâ€™s responsibility:

- You can invoke the CP&CG to ensure constructive participation by everyone
- You can discuss possible violations with your conveners or meeting hosts
- You can discuss directly with the subset of the Ethics Task Force which forms [the CP&CG response team](https://snowmass21.org/cpcg/start).  

For a deep dive into the CP&CG, please see [this recording](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/23818/contributions/197448/attachments/134659/167078/go) of the CP&CG training for Snowmass conveners ([slides](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/23818/contributions/197448/attachments/134659/166732/cpcgtraning.pdf)).
