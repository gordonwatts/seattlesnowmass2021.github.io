Welcome to the Seattle Community Summer Study Workshop home page!

**Registration** is due to open May 1st, 2022. And it is May 1st! We are waiting to fix one minor technical glitch and then we will have this open. We plan that this will be no latter than May 2nd! Email will be sent to many mailing lists once registration is officially open, and this page will be updated with links.

The Seattle meeting is the culmination of the various workshops and Town Hall meetings that have taken place during 2020, 2021, and 2022 as part of Snowmass21. As we have throughout the Snowmass process, we aim for everyone's voice to be heard. Contributions and participation from the community in this workshop are critical for the success of Snowmass21 and they will occur as part of one or more working groups directed by conveners.

Feel free to [send us an email](snowmass-loc2022@uw.edu) if there is information you can't find from the set of drop-down menus above, or the news items below!
